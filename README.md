Hi, Iâ€™m Bob Ombede, and these repositories are dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering JavaScript. Through these projects, I aim to strengthen my understanding of coding, scripting, and building interactive web interfaces, as I work towards becoming a skilled front-end and UI developer.

This collection covers a wide range of JavaScript topics, starting with the basics and progressing to more advanced concepts. It includes:

Core JavaScript (variables, functions, loops, arrays, objects, etc.)

DOM manipulation and event-driven programming

Asynchronous operations (Promises, async/await, APIs)

Modern JavaScript (ES6+ features)

Front-end UI/UX development basics

And more to come!


I welcome anyone interested to explore, contribute, or learn alongside me!
